# Memebot 

This is MemeBot, a discord bot.

If you are hosting yourself, you will need to create a file in the root directory of your local repository called 
`client_token` and paste your Discord developer client token into that file. Nothing else should be in the file.
From there, to run the bot, simply use

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Current commands that can be used in Discord:
    
    !help  - display help text
    !hello - print "Hello!"
    !poll  - create a simple poll
